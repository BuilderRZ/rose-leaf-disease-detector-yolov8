# 🌹 Rose Leaf Disease Detector using YOLOv8

A smart and lightweight AI web application to detect the health 
status of rose leaves using YOLOv8. This system was trained on a custom-labeled 
dataset using Roboflow and includes a CNN-based pre-filter to ensure only rose leaves are analyzed. 
The app is built with Flask and offers an interactive visual interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **YOLOv8-based disease detection**
- 🌿 **Pre-classification to detect whether the image is a rose leaf or not**
- 📦 **3 disease classes:** Healthy, Mild Infection, Severe Infection
- 📸 **Visual detection with bounding boxes**
- 📊 **Chart-based summary of results**
- 🧰 **Roboflow labeling & YOLOv8 training pipeline**
- 💡 Easy to run locally with simple Flask setup

## 🚦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rose-leaf-disease-detector-yolov8.git
cd rose-leaf-disease-detector-yolov8
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app:
python app.py
Open in browser:
http://127.0.0.1:5000
📌 Notes
The YOLOv8 model is located in yolov8_model/best.pt and trained on rose leaf datasets annotated with Roboflow.

All uploaded images are processed and visualized with bounding boxes + disease info.

The CNN model helps filter out non-rose leaf images before running YOLOv8.
